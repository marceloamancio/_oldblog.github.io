My research background is on Natural Language Processing with research masters on Question Generation at University of SaÌƒo Paulo.

Currently I am a freelancer who provide Machine Learning solutions for medium-sized companies.

What excites me is to create new technologies specially using Machine Learning.

I  also have a great passion for teaching and education.
